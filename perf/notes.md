Here’s a “go‑ham” run‑through of every leaky hotspot from your pprof and exactly how to squeeze more performance out of each layer:

Buffer syscalls with bufio.Reader/Writer.

Generate or swap JSON library to avoid reflection.

Pool encoders/decoders and buffers.

Replace fmt with lightweight logging.

Move to binary protocols if JSON is too heavy.

Tune TCP (NODELAY, buffer sizes).

Pipeline work to overlap CPU & IO.

Measure after each change with pprof and bench.
