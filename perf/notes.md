1. BaselinePerf doc
Buffer syscalls with bufio.Reader/Writer.
Generate or swap JSON library to avoid reflection.
Pool encoders/decoders and buffers.
Replace fmt with lightweight logging.
Move to binary protocols if JSON is too heavy.
Tune TCP (NODELAY, buffer sizes).
Pipeline work to overlap CPU & IO.
Measure after each change with pprofÂ and bench.

Sprint is very slow for structs due to use of deep reflection. Use custom ser/deser here.

But for floats, it is faster than a naive generic implementation, because of good optimizations. So be careful with optimizations. Run reflect_test to see the same.
